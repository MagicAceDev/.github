# MagicAce Development

**Clever solutions to unique problems**

Welcome to MagicAce's open source home. We're a UK-based software development agency that believes great code is written by humans, for humans.

## ðŸš€ Our Open Source Projects

### [magic-stack](https://github.com/MagicAceDev/magic-stack)
**The battle-tested tech stack for rapid development**

A batteries-included template for building modern web and mobile applications. Combines Astro, React, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, and more in a production-ready foundation that we've refined through years of real-world projects.

### [tailcomp](https://github.com/MagicAceDev/tailcomp)
**The TailwindCSS Composer**

A TypeScript library that makes composing Tailwind CSS classes simpler and more efficient. Features TypeScript-powered autocomplete and a structured object syntax that eliminates long, hard-to-read class strings.

Spot-the-difference coding challenges that help developers improve their attention to detail and achieve pixel-perfect results. Currently in beta.

## ðŸŽ¯ Our Philosophy

We contribute to the open source community because we believe:
- **Developer experience matters** - Tools should empower, not frustrate
- **Battle-tested is better** - We share what we actually use in production
- **Human-centered development** - Technology should serve people, not the other way around
